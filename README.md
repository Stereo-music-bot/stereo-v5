## Self hosting notice

This is a note for all the users thinking of hosting this bot yourself. First of all, do **not** publish this bot to a Discord bot list. We do not want to get public copies of Stereo on the internet saying the got created by someone else.

Please keep the credits where they are at all times, we have worked very hard on this project and in order to keep it free, we want to get the credits so people will keep supporting us.

We will provide a guide on how to host it yourself, please consult the installation guide when you are going to host this music bot yourself. We are **not** providing any self hosting support at this time.
